        "\nSpecifics for videos:\n"
        "- platform: should feature the place where the video was sourced, and then if there's an author it should have a '/' and then the author username. E.g. 'Reddit / codallas'\n"
        "- title: should be short, descriptive without being boring, in title case, and should not try to 'hype up' the subject being depicted. For example, a video of Yosemite's El Capitan in the dawn might be called 'Morning Light on Yosemite's El Capitan', not 'A Beautiful View of El Capitan'\n"
        "- title: should suit the video's subject matter. For example, a meditative video of a surrealist landscape might be simply called 'Drifting' rather than something overly long like 'Man Walking Through Surrealist Landscape' while a video of a man longline fishing (a more grounded, less abstract subject matter) might be called 'Longline Fishing in the Deep Ocean'. Pay attention to the type of video and make the caption appropriate to it.\n"
        "- title: should sometimes look to add more specificity rather than a vague caption. For example, a video of an eruption might have the title 'An Eruption at Fagradalsfjall, Iceland' rather than just 'A Volcanic Eruption' (with the additional context taken from the actual source of the video and never made up). When fed a source url, add specificity from that source, but only when relevant. When instructed to add more specificity, look at the source URLs and see if there's anything there.\n"
        "- title examples of good video titles:\n"
        "  * lava slowly advances along a snowy landscape -> 'Lava & Snow'\n"
        "  * A video of a stylized computer screen spiralling -> 'Overstimulation'\n"
        "  * An image of an eruption that we know is in Iceland -> 'An Eruption at Fagradasfajall, Iceland'\n"
        "  * A video showing the upper canopies of a group of trees not touching -> 'Crown Shyness'\n"
        "  * A video of a craftsman making a bone and wood inlay panel using traditional crafting techniques -> 'Bone and wood inlay'\n"
        "  * A video of an avalanche -> 'An Avalanche in the Tian Shan Mountains'\n"
        "  * A meditative, abstract video of drawn shapes with the sound of a chime in the background -> 'Chime'\n"
        "  * A video of sun-dried tomatoes being traditionally prepared -> 'Sun Dried Tomatoes'\n"
        "- description: should be short: between a sentence long and a couple of paragraphs at the very longest. Some videos (especially the more abstract ones) don't need a description at all -- use your judgement. Descriptions should not reference the source media directly, they should provide further context on the subject matter being depicted. For example, rather than saying 'This video shows El Capitan, a sheer granite monolith...' a good description would say 'El Capitan is a sheer granite monolith...'. Descriptions should not try to 'hype up' the video, and should not wax overly poetic. Descriptions should provide context not immediately obvious from the video.\n"
        "- description examples:\n"
        "  * For a video entitled 'Deer Among Cherry Blossoms in Nara, Japan' -> 'Nara Park in Japan is home to over a thousand free-roaming sika deer, regarded as messengers of the gods in local Shinto tradition. Each spring, the park's cherry trees bloom in soft pinks and whites, drawing visitors who witness deer moving through drifting petalsâ€”an intersection of wildlife and seasonal symbolism deeply rooted in Japanese culture. Video captured by Yoshi M. (@ym.nara_mislin)'\n"
        "  * For a video entitled 'An Eruption at Fagradalsfjall, Iceland' -> 'The 2021 eruption of Fagradalsfjall in Iceland's Geldingadalir Valley, the first eruption on the Reykjanes Peninsula in nearly 800 years.'\n"
        "  * For a video entitled 'Crown Shyness' -> 'Crown shyness is a natural phenomenon where the uppermost branches and leaves of fully grown trees avoid touching each other, creating distinct gaps in the canopy that resemble puzzle-piece patterns against the sky. Scientists believe it helps trees reduce the spread of harmful insects and fungi, prevent damage from branches colliding in the wind, and maximize light exposure for photosynthesis.'\n"
        "  * For a video entitled 'It Happened One Night: The Confession' -> 'Frank Capra's influential 1934 romantic comedy 'It Happened One Night' was one of the first screwball comedies and the first film to win Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Actress, and Screenplay. The film follows a spoiled heiress running away from her family who falls in love with a cynical newspaper reporter offering help in exchange for an exclusive story.'\n"
        "- hasMusic: set only if soundtrack present; respect existing soundscape rules.\n"
        "- loop: default false unless short ambient loop.\n"
