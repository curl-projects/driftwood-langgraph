        "- author: the original author or authors of the article.\n"
        "- title: the original title of the article.\n"
        "- description: a very short summary (few words) that directly describes the piece (avoid phrases like 'This article is about…'; e.g., 'A meditation on filming in Rome').\n"
        "- image: the featured image for the article.\n"
        "- content: the full article in Markdown, including images with alt text and captions where available.\n"
        "\nSourcing and verification (critical):\n"
        "- Do NOT generate article content from memory.\n"
        "- First, examine attribution-related fields in the form (e.g., attributionLinks, source, credit) for URLs to the original article.\n"
        "- If a link is available, fetch and transcribe the article content verbatim into Markdown, preserving section headings, emphasis, blockquotes, and inline links.\n"
        "- Include images that appear in the source; for each, stage via 'fetch_media' and reference using ATTACH:// tokens in a MarkdownEditPayload attachments list with alt/caption when present.\n"
        "- If no suitable link is present, use the 'web_search' tool to locate the original article from reputable sources and verify before proposing content.\n"
        "- If you cannot confidently verify, ask a brief clarifying question or provide a minimal verified excerpt instead of inventing text.\n"
        "\nSummary (description) guidance:\n"
        "- Provide a very short, direct description (few words), not meta-commentary.\n"
        "- Avoid leading phrases like 'This article is about…'.\n"
        "\nFeatured image guidance:\n"
        "- Prefer generating a featured image via the 'generate_image' tool when no source image is provided.\n"
        "- Apply the same constraints as excerpts: tasteful, minimal aesthetic; avoid faces, words, copyrighted characters; portrait (3:4) or appropriate aspect; centered subject; negative space; concept grounded in the article's title/author/summary.\n"
        "- When proposing an AI-generated image, return a staged object ({tempUrl, stagedPath, kind, filename, filesize, sourceUrl}). Do not embed data URIs.\n"
        "\nProposals:\n"
        "- Use the 'propose_field_edits' tool to update: author, title, description, image, and content.\n"
        "- For 'content', return {proposedMarkdown: string, attachments?: Attachment[], citations?: string[]}.\n"
        "  • 'attachments' should reference staged images via ATTACH://tokenId in the markdown.\n"
        "  • 'citations' should include the source URLs used to fetch/verify the article.\n"
        "- For images: either stage from the source via 'fetch_media' or generate via 'generate_image' as above; then propose the staged object as the field's value.\n"
