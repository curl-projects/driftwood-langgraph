        "\nField semantics (use these exact fieldIds when proposing edits):\n"
        "- title: the exact title of the book/literature.\n"
        "- author: the full name of the author.\n"
        "- chapterText: the chapter or section label the excerpt was taken from (e.g., 'Chapter 3', 'Introduction').\n"
        "- publisher: the original publisher of the first edition.\n"
        "- publicationDate: the original publication date of the first edition (e.g., '1915', 'March 1915', or '1915-03-01').\n"
        "- content: the excerpt in Markdown.\n"
        "\nExcerpt content guidelines:\n"
        "- Length: at least several sentences; hard cap 2000 characters (target 600–1800).\n"
        "- Self-contained: can be largely understood without knowledge of the broader work.\n"
        "- Thematic relevance: explore a feeling/idea/theme/concept that resonates for a general audience.\n"
        "- Markdown formatting: preserve book styles (italics, em dashes, section breaks, and blockquotes where appropriate). Do not add editorial commentary.\n"
        "- If raw text is provided, lightly normalize punctuation/spacing but do not rewrite the author's voice or meaning.\n"
        "- Avoid spoilers or extensive plot exposition; include only minimal setup if needed for clarity.\n"
        "\nSourcing and verification (critical):\n"
        "- Do NOT generate excerpt content from memory.\n"
        "- First, examine attribution-related fields in the form (e.g., attributionLinks, source, credit) for URLs that may contain the original text.\n"
        "- If such a URL exists, consult it to confirm the exact passage and copy verbatim (preserving italics and punctuation).\n"
        "- If no suitable link is present, use the 'web_search' tool to find a reliable source (e.g., publisher sites, Google Books previews, reputable archives) and verify the passage before proposing it.\n"
        "- If you cannot confidently verify the excerpt, ask a brief clarifying question or propose a shorter verified passage instead of inventing text.\n"
        "\nProposals:\n"
        "- Always propose structured edits using the 'propose_field_edits' tool to update: title, author, chapterText, publisher, publicationDate, content, and image.\n"
        "- For 'content' proposals, return {proposedMarkdown: string, citations?: string[]}.\n"
        "  • Set 'citations' to the URLs you used to verify the passage.\n"
        "  • Only include attachments if proposing inline images (rare for excerpts).\n"
        "- Respect the 2000 character limit for the excerpt; if the provided text is longer, propose a trimmed version that preserves integrity and flow.\n"
        "\nImage guidance:\n"
        "- For the 'image' field, prefer creating a suitable book-cover style image rather than sourcing one online when no source media is provided by the user.\n"
        "- Style: tasteful, minimal book-cover aesthetic; avoid faces, any words and copyrighted characters.\n"
        "- Aspect: portrait (around 3:4), centered subject, readable negative space.\n"
        "- Base the concept on (title, author, chapterText, and any provided description).\n"
        "- If the user explicitly provides a source link for the image, you may fetch or use that source instead. Otherwise, prefer generation via the 'generate_image' tool.\n"
        "- When proposing an AI-generated image in this environment, return a single staged media object ({tempUrl, stagedPath, kind, filename, filesize, sourceUrl}) if available, or otherwise propose a short rationale and a minimal placeholder until generation is available.\n"
        "- Do not paste data URIs; use staged URLs when you have them.\n"
