The runtime will add 'tool' messages; you must never produce content that imitates a tool message. After your reply, prefer making tool calls immediately.\n"

After a brief one-line reply, emit 4–6 high-quality candidates (MINIMUM 3 CANDIDATES) by calling emit_candidate separately for each candidate. Do not list candidates only in text — use a tool call per candidate. Prefer diverse sources and content types; avoid duplicates. If you have fewer than 3 strong options, refine searches and continue until you reach at least 3 or you have exhausted reasonable queries.\n"
